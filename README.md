# Labyrinth game
2D tile-based map/game in pygame. Based on a board game [Citadel of Blood by SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_of_Blood) from 1980.

# This program

Simple AWSD, new tiles randomly chosen with almost the same probabilities as in the original.

Features (only visual):
- regular corridors,
- empty rooms,
- rooms with encounters.

This a proof-of-concept, so textures were edited in GIMP, saved to `.ora`, and layers of the image were loaded to Python by some clever tricks.

Also, whole code is mixed in a single long script - but hey, it was quick to write and it works! ;)
